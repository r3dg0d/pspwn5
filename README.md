A repo dedicated to reverse engineering the PS5 and creating a CFW to run modified homebrew apps.

# UPDATE: PS5 JAILBROKEN!
https://www.engadget.com/ps5-jailbreak-pt-firmware-155201757.html


⚠️NOTICE⚠️

I will be purchasing a jailbreakable PS5 when I have the money. Then I will begin working on an appstore for the PS5, as well as its own CFW. HMU if you are a coder and want to publish your application on it when its complete. 

Some projects that are PS5 Related:

PS5-VPN

FREESTORE

HOMEBREW STORE

DEEPBLUE-CFW (PS5 CUSTOM FIRMWARE)

PS5UIKIT

PS5CONTROLKIT

CHROMIUMPS5

VMPS5

EMULATOR5

PS5-VOICE-SEARCH

Gamehacks

Free-iAP-Purchases


⚗️The Majority of development will be sifting through official firmware code and understanding it, even printing out the code on paper and reading it. The other half will be Coding a new CFW .PUP Update file for the PS5, as well as changing the recovery via keyboard and F12 / DEL on boot.


Basically, completely reverse-engineering the PS5 into a beast Gaming PC.
Yeah... it's gonna be a long project.
