- Code will not be uploaded until its perfected for the end-consumer. This is just a write-up.

# üçª UPDATE: PS5 JAILBROKEN!

‚ö†Ô∏èNOTICE‚ö†Ô∏è

I will be purchasing a jailbreakable PS5 when I have the money. Then I will begin working on an appstore for the PS5, as well as its own CFW. HMU if you are a coder and want to publish your application on it when its complete. 

üíï Some projects that are PS5 Related:

PS5-Emulator

PS5-VPN

PS5-IO

PS5-Discord

PS5-File-Manager

PS5-Steam

PS5-Themes

PS5-LIVE

FREESTORE (Every Playstation game and app, free, and searchable) [ILLEGAL] [EXPENSIVE] [Codename: AnonStore]

Privacy and Anonymity-focused PS5-CFW (PS5 CUSTOM FIRMWARE) [CODENAME: ZanderOS]

PS5-UIKIT

PS5-CONTROLKIT

TWITTER-PS5

CHROMIUM-PS5

PS5-Virtualbox

EMULATOR5

PS5-VOICE-SEARCH

Gamehacks (BANNABLE) [Project Yawn]

Free-iAP-Purchases (based on cydia tweak)

[Likelihood of bricking PS5 if something goes wrong: 89%]

‚öóÔ∏èThe Majority of development will be sifting through official firmware code and understanding it, even printing out the code on paper and reading it. The other half will be Coding a new CFW .PUP Update file for the PS5, as well as changing the recovery via keyboard and F12 / DEL on boot.

üí°Idea, but a pretty bad one, is removing the ssd from the ps5, and puttin it into a pc with windows so you can see the entire PS5 FS. Would need to build a whole new PC though, lmfao...


Basically, completely reverse-engineering the PS5 into a beast Gaming PC.
Yeah... it's gonna be a long project.
