# pspwn5
A repo dedicated to reverse engineering the PS5 and creating a CFW to run modified homebrew apps.

# UPDATE: PS5 JAILBROKEN!
https://www.engadget.com/ps5-jailbreak-pt-firmware-155201757.html
I will be purchasing a jailbreakable PS5 when I have the money to test the jailbreak, as well as begin development on a PS5 CFW. Shit will look cool, a lot like what homebrew on the switch is like. Might even get as good as jailbreaking an iPhone.

# To-Do
- Experiment in PS5 OFW (official firmware)
- Try to find some way to activate webkit (User guide, Help guide)
- MITM on your router to said URL, and change the url to a custom-crafted payload, which can interface with PS5 memory.
- If possible try to dump OFW source code, or find OFW Source code
- Try finding an RCE (Remote Code Execution)
- Figure out how to dump OFW source code or access filesystem
- Update files are pretty hard to reverse-engineer. Tried updating via USB, PS5 doesn't like it.
