# pspwn5
- A Repo dedicated to reverse engineering the PS5 into an absolute fucking monster.

- Code will not be uploaded until its perfected for the end-consumer. This is just a write-up.

# 🍻 UPDATE: PS5 FW 4.XX JAILBROKEN, DEBUG SETTINGS ENABLED!
- 📰 https://www.engadget.com/ps5-jailbreak-pt-firmware-155201757.html
- ➡️ https://gamerhack.github.io/ ⬅️

⚠️NOTICE⚠️

I will be purchasing a jailbreakable PS5 when I have the money. Then I will begin working on an appstore for the PS5, as well as its own CFW. HMU if you are a coder and want to publish your application on it when its complete.

[Likelihood of bricking PS5 if something goes wrong: 89%]

⚗️The Majority of development will be sifting through official firmware code and understanding it, even printing out the code on paper and reading it. The other half will be Coding a new CFW .PUP Update file for the PS5, as well as changing the recovery via keyboard and F12 / DEL on boot.

💡Idea, but a pretty bad one, is removing the ssd from the ps5, and puttin it into a pc with windows so you can see the entire PS5 FS. Would need to build a whole new PC though, lmfao...

^^ Better just use PS5-FTP (File Transfer Protocol) with User Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loaYZWOSPHE 


😍 This project is basically, completely reverse-engineering the PS5 into a beast Gaming PC.
Yeah... it's gonna be a long project.

- Disable PS5 updates, then Jailbreak
- Install some pkg files
- edit code, and make sick webapps for PS5.
- port pre-existing webapps (pornhub, twitter, etc.)
- install chrome .pkg
- install filemanager .pkg
- Start work on PS5 CFW + Theming.

If you want to donate some crypto so I can buy a PS5, I'll gladly take like $500 of bitcoin to buy one.
PM me for my btc address.
